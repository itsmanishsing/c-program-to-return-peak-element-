//An element is called a peak element if its value is not smaller than the value of its adjacent elements(if they exists).....
Example 1:
Input:
N = 3
arr[] = {1,2,3}
Output: 2
Explanation: index 2 is 3.
It is the peak element as it is 
greater than its neighbour 2.

Your Task:
You don't have to read input or print anything. Complete the function peakElement() which takes the array arr[] and its size N as input parameters and (((return the index of any one of its peak elements.)))



#include<iostream>
using namespace std;


int peakelement(int arr[], int  n)
{

int i, s;
for(i=0;i<n;i++)
{
 if(arr[i]>arr[i-1])
   s = i; 
   //s = arr[i]; // it will return the peak element...


}
return s;

}
//DRIVER CODE

int main()
{
    int pk; 
int arr[] = {1,3,5,70,5};
int n = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]);
pk = peakelement(arr,n);
cout<<pk<<endl;

    return 0;
}
